2) HOMEPAGE MEDIA CONTENT, MEDIA PAGE?:
        
    a) HOMEPAGE MEDIA CONTENT
        1) Secondary header template
        2) 
            case a) Highlights from their twitch team channel?  They need to be informed of this.  
            
            case b) The video assets they gave us?  I know they have better assets than those, I don't like this.

            case c) Some other assets they give us?  

            case d) Instagram feed?  May not be impossible.  I keep flip flopping on this- either that or I keep looking at it and deciding it's not realistic.  I prefer case a.

            case e) Something else, I'm open to ideas.
            
        3) *Recent tweets / instagram / fb posts or something
        4) Maybe some recent blog posts, like two or something
        5) Footer template

    b) MEDIA PAGE?
        1) Secondary header template
        2) 
            case a) a grid of assorted pictures and clips, ideally twitch highlights.

            case b) Don't even make a media page.  Just have a link to their team twitch. 
            
        3) Footer template
        
3) BASIC CLEANUP, QUESTIONS:
    
    a) BASIC CLEANUP
        1) Is everything tight with the media queries?  Good on all browsers? Good on all devices?
        2) Does the contact form actually work?  >_>
        3) *****REFORMAT TO USE TEMPLATES******
        4) ^^ This will just make our life easier, and is worth making a second, dramatic bullet for.  This should be done first.
    
    b) QUESTIONS
        1) Image assets?  I mean we have these placeholder images and they look alright but we should really use something else?  The easiest solution might be to see if dave can make some cool images that will fill that space and match the aesthetic.
